In order to get my config for the zsh shell working, you must have powerlevel10k installed to your system. The link can be found here:
https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#manual

For autocompletion and syntax coloring, you can run the as.sh script which is also within this directory and then close out of zsh and reopen it.
Also, please note that a couple things in my zsh config are specific for Macbook Pros since that is what I have. It shouldn't cause any issues for you, but if you want you can remove the MBP specific stuff.
